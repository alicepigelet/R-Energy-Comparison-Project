# Comparative Energy and Emissions Analysis of Clean Tech Materials

## üåç Purpose

This project analyzes and compares the energy use and carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) emissions associated with manufacturing three key clean tech materials: porous silica beads, zeolites, and glass. These materials are central to applications in renewable energy, filtration, and catalysis. However, their production processes vary widely in energy intensity and environmental impact. By quantifying energy input and emissions at each manufacturing stage, this analysis helps identify which materials and processes are more sustainable‚Äîoffering insights for cleaner industrial practices and climate policy.

This data analysis project investigates the sustainability of manufacturing three common clean-tech materials‚Äîporous silica beads, zeolites, and soda-lime glass‚Äîby comparing their respective energy demands and carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) emissions. These materials are foundational in emerging green technologies, yet the environmental cost of their production is often overlooked in policy and investment discussions. This project aims to provide a transparent and reproducible comparison that highlights the most resource-intensive production stages and suggests potential paths for improving industrial sustainability.

Using data compiled from industrial Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) and technical documentation, the analysis focuses on three core stages of production: raw material preparation, core processing (e.g., heating, drying, crystallization), and finishing (e.g., milling, annealing). A cleaned dataset in .csv format was analyzed using R, primarily with the tidyverse and ggplot2 libraries, to calculate total energy input (in GJ/ton), CO‚ÇÇ emissions (kg/ton), and CO‚ÇÇ intensity per unit energy (kg/GJ).

The results indicate that glass production is the most energy- and carbon-intensive of the three, primarily due to its high-temperature melting processes. Zeolite manufacturing, while less intensive than glass, still results in considerable emissions, especially during hydrothermal synthesis and calcination. Porous silica beads emerged as the most sustainable option, showing the lowest total energy demand and CO‚ÇÇ output. In all cases, the core Processing stage dominates both energy and emissions profiles, making it the prime candidate for optimization.

A key insight from the analysis is the relatively stable CO‚ÇÇ-per-GJ ratio across all materials, suggesting that the carbon intensity of energy sources used in production (e.g., grid electricity, fossil fuels) is a major driver of emissions. Thus, reducing both the amount of energy consumed and improving the energy source‚Äîthrough electrification or renewable integration‚Äîcan have a compounded impact on reducing overall emissions.

From a policy and industrial standpoint, the analysis underscores the importance of material choice, process optimization, and energy source decarbonization. Manufacturers, investors, and regulators can use these insights to prioritize greener technologies and support clean energy transitions in the industrial sector. The reproducible code and clear visuals make this project a valuable tool for sustainability researchers, engineering students, and stakeholders in clean tech innovation.
