# Comparative Energy and Emissions Analysis of Clean Tech Materials

## 🌍 Purpose

This project analyzes and compares the energy use and carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions associated with manufacturing three key clean tech materials: porous silica beads, zeolites, and glass. These materials are central to applications in renewable energy, filtration, and catalysis. However, their production processes vary widely in energy intensity and environmental impact. By quantifying energy input and emissions at each manufacturing stage, this analysis helps identify which materials and processes are more sustainable—offering insights for cleaner industrial practices and climate policy.
